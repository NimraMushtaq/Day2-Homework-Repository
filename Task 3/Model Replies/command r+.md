The story is set in Finland in the early 19th century and follows the lives of Grubert Reuss, his children Blonda and Tonie, and their close friend, Pastor Bertholm Oshart. Grubert, a woodcutter, leaves his children alone in their log hut while he travels to sell his wooden carvings. Pastor Oshart visits the children and entrusts them with a bag of money for the poor, which he fears may be stolen by the Valden family, a lawless and unprincipled group in the village of Carfoos.

That night, the Valden brothers, Dorlat, Hervitz, and Jaspar, break into the Reuss cottage in search of the money. Freskel Valden, a half-witted youth devoted to the pastor, helps the children escape and hides the bag of money on the Isle of Ghosts, an island in a nearby lake.

As winter approaches, Grubert returns home with a broken arm, unable to work. Tonie takes his place, but only earns half-pay. The family struggles financially, and Blonda notices that a roll of linen towelling she had woven is missing. She suspects Freskel, who has been acting strangely.

During a hunting trip, Blonda and Tonie see a light flashing on the Isle of Ghosts and suspect the Valdens of searching for the money. They also encounter General Nicolai, who expresses interest in the island's legend and promises to help the Reuss family if needed.

Freskel confesses to Pastor Oshart that he found the treasure on the Isle of Ghosts but kept it a secret, acting as a ghost to scare away intruders. He reveals that the treasure has been stolen, and the pastor comforts him, encouraging him to find solace in God's forgiveness and the promise of heavenly treasure.
