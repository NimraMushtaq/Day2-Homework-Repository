# Day 2 Homework Repository

This is Nimra Mushtaq. In this repository, I have implemented all three tasks related to text analysis given by the AI BootCamp in India, Day 2 Homework.

I have used different free versions of LLMs I had access to, mainly ChatGPT 3.5, Gemini, and Command R+. 

## Tasks Overview

- **Task 1: Code Analysis**  
  I selected three tasks from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/), solved them with ChatGPT, and verified the results. You can find the details in the `task1` folder.

- **Task 2: Text Generation**  
  I summarized my key takeaways from the course and generated one-pager instructions for two different roles (Business Analyst, Quality Assurance) using ChatGPT. The results are stored in the `task2` folder.

- **Task 3: Data Extraction**  
  I picked a text from [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/) and extracted key facts, summarizing them as requested. The findings can be found in the `task3` folder.
